2- BreastCancer Dataset
3- MNIST Dataset
4- Diabetes Dataset (Classification Version)
5- Iris Dataset

# Training Algorithms

1- KNN Regression
2- Linear Regression
3- Polynomial Regression
4- Support Vector Regression
5- Multi-Layer Perceptron Regression
6- KNN Classifier
7- Logistic Regression
8- Decision Tree Classifier
9- Random Forest Classifier
10- Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier
